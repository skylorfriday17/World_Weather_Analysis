# World_Weather_Analysis

In this analysis I was able to create scatter plots and line regression analysis for the weather of random cities around the world. Based on certain weather conditions of those observed cities, I could tell if there was a correlation between them and the latitude of the cities. After completing that analysis I was able to plot those points on a map and then filter those cities with certain conditions that seemed most suitable for me as a vacation spot. When I narrowed it down Iwas able to find the nearest hotel to those cities and plot those on a map as well!
